## Train Tracker with Apache Kafka (Java)

Real-time simulation of a train traveling from Houston to Denton with positions streamed via Kafka, consumed in Java, and visualized on a Leaflet web map (with smooth animation + trail).

## âœ¨ Features

- Producer streams GPS-like points along a curvy, realistic route (Houston â†’ Denton).

- Consumer keeps only the latest position per vehicle in memory.

- Embedded Web server exposes:

    - GET /positions â†’ live JSON of latest positions

    - GET /route â†’ planned route (GeoJSON LineString)

    - GET /ui â†’ simple JSON viewer (auto-refresh)

    - GET /map â†’ interactive map with:

- ðŸš† custom train icon

- Buttery-smooth motion between samples

- Trail polyline (recent path)

- Single topic: vehicle.positions.v1

- Ready to scale to multiple trains (IDs) later.
